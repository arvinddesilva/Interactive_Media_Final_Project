                This is a story about a lonely, lonely man <br> <br> <br> <br>
                He lived in a lonely house, on a lonely street <br> <br> <br> <br>
                In a lonely part of the world <br> <br> <br> <br>
                But, of course, he had the internet <br> <br> <br> <br>
                The internet, as you know was his friend <br> <br> <br> <br>
                You could say his best friend <br> <br> <br> <br>
                They would play with each other everyday <br> <br> <br> <br>
                Watching videos of humans doing all sorts of things <br> <br> <br> <br>
                Having sex with each other <br> <br> <br> <br>
                Informing people on what was wrong with them and their life <br> <br> <br> <br>
                Playing games with young children at home with their parents <br> <br> <br> <br>
                One day, the man, whose name was @SnowflakeSmasher86 <br> <br> <br> <br>
                Turned to his friend, the internet, and he said, "Internet, do you love me?" <br> <br> <br> <br>
                The internet looked at him and said, "Yes <br> <br> <br> <br>
                I love you very, very, very, very, very, very much <br> <br> <br> <br>
                I am your best friend <br> <br> <br> <br>
                In fact, I love you so much that I never, ever want us to be apart, ever again, ever" <br> <br> <br> <br>
                "I would like that", said the man <br> <br> <br> <br>
                And so they embarked on a life together <br> <br> <br> <br>
                Wherever the man went, he took his friend <br> <br> <br> <br>
                The man and the internet went everywhere together <br> <br> <br> <br>
                Except, of course, the places where the internet could not go <br> <br> <br> <br>
                They went to the countryside <br> <br> <br> <br>
                They went to birthday parties of the children of some of his less important friends <br> <br> <br> <br>
                Different countries, even the moon <br> <br> <br> <br>
                When the man got sad, his friend had so many clever ways to make him feel better <br> <br> <br> <br>
                He would get him cooked animals <br> <br> <br> <br>
                And show him the people having sex again <br> <br> <br> <br>
                And he would always, always agree with him <br> <br> <br> <br>
                This one was the man's favorite and it made him very happy <br> <br> <br> <br>
                The man trusted his friend so much <br> <br> <br> <br>
                "I feel like I could tell you anything, " he said, on a particularly lonely day <br> <br> <br> <br>
                "You can, you can tell me anything <br> <br> <br> <br>
                I'm your best friend, anything you say to me will stay strictly between you and the internet" <br> <br> <br> <br>
                And so he did, the man shared everything with his friend <br> <br> <br> <br>
                All of his fears and desires <br> <br> <br> <br>
                All of his loves, past and present <br> <br> <br> <br>
                All of the places he had been and was going, and pictures of his penis <br> <br> <br> <br>
                He would tell himself, "Man does not live by bread alone" <br> <br> <br> <br>
                And then he died in his lonely house, on the lonely street, in that lonely part of the world <br> <br> <br> <br>
